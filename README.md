# Library_Management_System

**How to use**
 - Just run the main.c with the other files in the same directory and you should be good to go


**Features**
- Admin / Login system
- basic library management options (Direct record manipulation features are based on account type admin/user)
   - Add / Delete Book
   - Search for book
   - Issue book to a user
   - View all available books
   - Edit book records


**What I learned**
 
 * C/C++ file system
 
 * Simple admin/login system
 
 * Utilizing structs alongside the file system


**Disclaimer**
 - Group Project / Library System / My work includes any file with Karim in it and all that's in the main.c file
 - No security features - all data is written onto text files saved locally in the same directory as the project
