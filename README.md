# Library_Management_System

How to use
 - Just run the main.c file and you should be good to go


What I learned
 
 * C/C++ file system
 
 * Simple admin/login system
 
 * Utilizing structs alongside the file system


Disclaimer
 - Group Project / Library System / My work includes any file with Karim in it and all that's in the main.c file
